This represents a typical SDK wrapper for a REST web service is a software development kit (SDK) that simplifies the process of accessing and using a web service that follows the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. The SDK wrapper abstracts the low-level details of making HTTP requests, parsing responses, and handling errors, providing a higher-level interface that developers can use to interact with the web service.

The project structure is as follows:

Project root

> Node_modules //generated
> postman 
    |_collection.json //A postman collection that interfaces with the host service 
> source
    |_ > lib //folder for custom classes/functions/modules
    |       |_API.js //endpoint communication
    |       |_ringSDK.js //SDK methods
    |       |_ > test
    |               |_index.test.js //Jest tests
    |_.babelrc //your local configuration for your code in your project
    |_.env //contain credentials and other key-value parameters used for development
    |_DESIGN.md //this file
    |_nodemon.json //node watch file directives
    |_package-lock.json //lock file holding dependency information
    |_package.json //project meta-data and dependency information
    |_README.md //project description and getting started documentation

    Overall, this SDK wrapper for a REST web service should provide a higher-level, more developer-friendly interface to the LOTR web service, making it easier to integrate the service into applications and services.
